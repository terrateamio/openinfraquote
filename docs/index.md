# What is OpenInfraQuote?

**OpenInfraQuote** is an open source CLI tool that estimates the cost of your infrastructure using Terraform plans and state files, entirely offline and under your control.

[Get Started â†’](./getting-started/installation.md)

## Why OpenInfraQuote?

!!! note ""
    - **Fully Open Source**: No proprietary components, API keys, or usage limits
    - **Local Processing**: No data is sent to external servers
    - **Plan & State Support**: Works directly with Terraform plans and state files
    - **CI/CD Ready**: Simple CLI that integrates easily into existing workflows

## How It Works

OpenInfraQuote analyzes your Terraform plan or state files to identify resources that will be created, modified, or destroyed. It then uses local pricing data to estimate the cost of those resources. This process happens in two steps:

1. **Match**: Parse a Terraform plan or state file and match resources to pricing data.
2. **Price**: Estimate cost using a pricing sheet.

The output gives a per-resource cost breakdown, helping teams understand and optimize their infrastructure budget.
