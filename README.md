## Examples

### Estimate Costs from a Terraform Plan

```sh
terraform plan -out=tf.plan
terraform show -json tf.plan > tfplan.json
oiq match --pricesheet prices.csv tfplan.json | oiq price --region us-east-1
```

Example output:
```
Match date: 2025-03-25T20:26:25
Price date: 2025-03-25T20:26:25
Match query: region=us-east-1

Min Price: 61.78 USD
Max Price: 63.85 USD
Min Price Diff: 61.78 USD
Max Price Diff: 63.85 USD

Resources
  Name      Type            Min Price (USD)  Max Price (USD)  Change
  example   aws_s3_bucket   61.78            63.85             add
```

In JSON format:
```sh
oiq match --pricesheet prices.csv tfplan.json | oiq price --region us-east-1 --format=json
```

### Estimate Current Costs from Terraform State

```sh
terraform state pull | terraform show --json > tfstate.json
oiq match --pricesheet prices.csv tfstate.json | oiq price --region us-east-1
```

## Region and Usage Configuration

### Region Handling

By default, OpenInfraQuote shows pricing across all regions. If you know which region to use, pass it explicitly with the `--region` flag. This is optional.

Plan and state files do not contain region information, so it must be provided manually if you want region-specific estimates.

### Usage-Based Estimates

Some cloud resources are priced based on usage, such as storage size or number of requests. OpenInfraQuote includes default estimates for common usage patterns to help provide directional cost data. You can customize these assumptions by providing your own `usage.json` file.

See an example usage file [here](https://github.com/terrateamio/openinfraquote/blob/main/files/usage.json).

---

## Running with Docker

To run OpenInfraQuote with Docker:

```sh
docker run --rm -i \
  -v $(pwd)/prices.csv:/prices.csv \
  -v $(pwd)/tfplan.json:/tfplan.json \
  ghcr.io/terrateamio/openinfraquote:latest \
  match --pricesheet /prices.csv /tfplan.json \
  | docker run --rm -i \
    ghcr.io/terrateamio/openinfraquote:latest \
    price --region us-east-1
```

## FAQ

### Is OpenInfraQuote 100% open-source?

Yes. There are no proprietary components or hidden features.

### Which cloud providers are supported?

Currently AWS. GCP and Azure support is coming soon.

### How accurate are the estimates?

Estimates are based on pricing data from official cloud provider APIs. OpenInfraQuote uses a pricing sheet (`prices.csv`) that is updated daily to reflect the latest public pricing. This file is downloaded and used locally, so your estimates stay current without needing a backend service.

Final costs depend on actual usage and any applicable discounts.
